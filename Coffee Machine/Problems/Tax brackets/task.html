  <p>In progressive tax systems, tax rates change according to the income. Tax brackets are divisions that regulate those changes.&nbsp;</p> 
  <p>Here's an example of tax brackets in a certain tax system:</p> 
  <p>0 — 15,527: 0% tax</p> 
  <p>15,528 — 42,707: 15% tax</p> 
  <p>42,708 — 85,414: 22% tax</p> 
  <p>85,415 — 132,406: 26% tax</p> 
  <p>132,407 and more: 28% tax</p> 
  <p>Suppose we use a simplified version of taxation and apply one&nbsp;tax rate to the entire amount of money.</p> 
  <p>Write a program that calculates the tax that a person's going to pay based on their income.</p> 
  <p><strong>The input format:</strong></p> 
  <p>The value of someone's taxable income (in dollars).</p> 
  <p><strong>The output format:</strong></p> 
  <p><code class="java">The tax for {income} is {percent}%.&nbsp;That is {calculated_tax} dollars!</code></p> 
  <p>The <code class="java">calculated_tax</code> should always have 2 decimal places.</p> 
  <p><button class="btn-sm btn-outline-secondary" onclick="getElementById('hint-891').style.display='inline'"> Hint </button> </p>
  <div id="hint-891" style="display:none;">
   We encourage you to use string formatting, since solutions with the&nbsp;
   <code class="java">round()</code>&nbsp;function may not pass the tests. Besides, this is exactly what the topic is about!
