<h2>Contacts page</h2>
<html>
 <head></head>
 <body>
  <p>Another page we want to add to the site is <em>"/contacts"</em>. We create an HTML template for it in the file <em>"book/templates/book/contacts.html"</em>.</p> 
  <p>There is no need to pass any additional data to it, just create a class that will serve this page on the site.</p> 
  <p></p>
  <div class="alert alert-warning">
    By default, Django is looking for templates in all of your "
   <em>&lt;application_name&gt;/templates</em>" directories, so we do not include "
   <em>book/templates</em>" in the template path, because Django will do it for us.
